In The Matrix, the main character Neo is offered the choice between a red pill and a blue pill by rebel leader
Morpheus. Morpheus says "You take the blue pill... the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever
you want to believe. You take the red pill... you stay in Wonderland, and
I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."</pre>

“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, 
it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. 
Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. 
The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, 
sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them 
actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. 
You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. 
Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, 
and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”
